# Headless Minecraft Kotlin (hl-mc-kt)

This project is going to be heavily based on [stevenerella](https://github.com/iceiix/stevenarella), mostly as a port of it to kotlin so that I can learn about how the project works and have an implementation of it in a language I understand better, I will most likely not port any GUI or rendering over.
